gears
=====

run mkgear.py in order to get a bunch of spur gear dxfs generated into the "gears\gearDXFs" folder

## Example
![](/images/gear_7_tooth.PNG "7 tooth gear")
![](/images/gear_19_tooth.PNG "19 tooth gear")

## Notes
The geometry library could use some work, probably restarting from scratch or just using someone elses?
The DXF file stuff in sdxf.py came from something I downloaded off of the internet ages ago, and is now available here: [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SDXF]
