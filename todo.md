# To Do
1. separate out geom library & consider others (potentially https://github.com/bengolder/python-geometry/tree/master/geometry)
1. documentation: at least create SVG doc showing all the angles and everything
1. allow creating of conjugate gear geometry from arbitrary:
  1. rack form
  1. gear tooth form
  1. path of contact
1. make it easy to generate special cases of gears
  1. cycloidal gears
  1. pin gears
1. wx examples, to demonstrate/explore:
  1. conjugate action requires normals of contact to pass through pitch point
  1. involute forms have conjugate action (relatively) independent of spacing & pitch dia
